Coming to college, I’ve found that it takes twice the amount of effort it used to take me in high school to not only get good grades but to truly understand the material. So far, I have received mostly A’s in my college career. There were a few classes that I really had to struggle and push myself, but I’m proud that I succeeded. Another achievement that makes me stand out is that I just very recently received an internship opportunity with a company doing statistical data analysis. It has taken a lot of work and it’s encouraging to receive tangible rewards for a change. Hopefully this internship will help me build a case for being accepted into graduate school after I finish college.",

Last semester was my first time that I truly enjoyed all my classes. This gave me the drive to work exceptionally hard on my classes, and led to the best GPA I’d ever received at any level of my education. In high school, I was really active in my choir program. I entered a singing competition with a friend to perform a duet. We practiced almost everyday. I was really nervous to sing in front of a judge because I knew how much work we had both put into our performance and musicianship. Turns out my partner and I received “Best of Center”, meaning we were the best that judge had heard all day. I was so proud of myself and of my partner.",

This is a very proud and exciting moment for me because I have always dreamed of studying in another country. I will be traveling to the Netherlands and learning the language while attending classes as well. I am also very proud of the fact that I am good at maintaining balance in my life compared to my friends. Being balanced and having a balanced life is one of the hardest things to pull off, especially when it feels like there are tasks, commitments, and opportunities that are always being thrown at you to manage. I feel like I’ve done a good job of achieving balance by having a strong sense of self-discipline and time management to do what I have to do. ",

I stepped up to the plate and acted professional, mature, and genuine. I am proud of how I acted in the whole process of university application. I sometimes look back on that time in my life and feel like I was becoming a person who could get things accomplished, could set a goal and meet it. Also, I am proud of making the most out of my time in college. College hasn’t always been the easiest, but I really believe that I have tried a bunch of different clubs and been a part of many different programs that my university offers. Through these programs I’ve been able to meet new people and gain new experiences. I’m excited to graduate in May and work towards a master’s degree.",
